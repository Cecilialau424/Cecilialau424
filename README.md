Hi there I am @ccla04<br>
Currently a year 12 student trying to figure out how to code<br>
Want to work on cool stuff but skills not shrp enough yet<br>
Love STEM especially maths rightnow<br>
After two lesson on linear algebra now I look at everything and think "CaN I wrItE ThiS iN mAtrIx?"<br>
Too obsessed with maths that I am not quite working on my other even more stressful subjects<br>
Should really start studying them or I will die in public exam lol<br>
Currently trying to learn Japanese<br>
